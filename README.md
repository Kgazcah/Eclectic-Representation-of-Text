## About The Project

The project is about how computing and linguistics are converging to equip computers with the ability to process and interpret complex sentence structures of human language, resulting in the emergence of areas like Text Mining and Natural Language Processing. Feature extraction is used to analyze language from a mathematical perspective to extract different text properties as a vector representation. Several feature extraction techniques are commonly used, depending on the purpose of the recognition task, and this project proposes a novel method called an eclectic representation that unifies different informative aspects to improve the effectiveness of recognition models
